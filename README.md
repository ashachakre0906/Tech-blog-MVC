## Description
Challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

- Backend route which Gets All existing Posts associated to a specific User
```js
router.get("/", withAuth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const getPost = await Post.findAll({
      where: { user_id: req.session.user_id },
      include: User,
    });
    const posts = getPost.map((post) => post.get({ plain: true })); //we are fetching the data and it gonna map each object and renders it on the page into the plain text
    res.render("all-posts-dashboard", {
      layout: "dashboard",
      posts,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    res.redirect("login");
  }
});
```
- FE fetching the api route `/api/posts'` to create new post using http method POST.
  ```js
  const newResponse = await fetch('/api/posts', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
          post_title,
          post_description,
      }),
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
  if (newResponse.ok) {
      document.location.replace('/dashboard');
  } else {
      alert('Unable to create new post')
  };
  ```
